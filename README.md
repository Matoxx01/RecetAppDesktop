# RecetApp Desktop Application GIT 

## With what technologies is it made
RecetApp are made with:
- NPM
- Electron
- Firebase
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

------------

These technologies are the strong point of RecetApp, they are easy to use and learn, they have helped me a lot in making my idea of RecetApp more complete.

## What it is about?
This app of recipes that you can create your own account and get favorite recipes, give likes to another ones, share with the community your delicius recipes and more. Thats the focus on this app. In the future I will make more functions that will probably make you want to download the application.

## How to install
First you clone the repository and start with the commands in the folder of the repository in this order:

------------

- `$ npm install` 
This installs the NPM libraries.
- `$ npm install firebase`
This installs the Firebase libraries.
- `$ npm install --save-dev electron@latest`
This installs Ionic libraries.

------------

With all installed, you can open the repository in VS Code or something else and open the terminal again, then you write `$ npm run start` to execute the app in your navigator.
